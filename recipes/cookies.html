<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These cookies are exactly the kinds that Joe ate shortly before passing away from food poisoning.
    (god bless that man) The exact food that killed Joe is unknown, but these cookies sure are to die
    for! This recipe was passed down to me by my witch mother in law shortly before my divorce. 

    If you want to try these cookies out for yourself, make sure you have all the ingredients listed
    and if you don't, feel free to substitute with your own ideas!
